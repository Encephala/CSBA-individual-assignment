# CSBA-individual-assignment

This is my solution to the individual assignment of the Computer Science for Business Analytics course (EUR).

The problem is to detect duplicates in a large set (1624) of product descriptions of TVs from the web.
This is done through preselection, applying locality-sensitive hashing to the data in order to find candidate duplicates,
so as to reduce the cost of the subsequent duplicate detection through `...`.

I did this assignment individually.

## ToDo
- Implement hard blocks for not being equal if in same shop, etc.
- Better item representation than (shingles of) title
    - (try to) Find brand of product
- Refactor `solution.py` to be modular and use a `main` function
- Tune some of the parameters (shingle size, n)
