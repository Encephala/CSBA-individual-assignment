# CSBA-individual-assignment

This is my solution to the individual assignment of the Computer Science for Business Analytics course (EUR).

The problem is to detect duplicates in a large set (1624) of product descriptions of TVs from the web.
This is done through preselection, applying locality-sensitive hashing to the data in order to find candidate duplicates,
so as to reduce the cost of the subsequent duplicate detection through the multi-component similarity method.

I did this assignment individually.

## ToDo
